## 🧠 What is it?

**Linear Correlation Coefficient Visualizer** is an interactive **Tkinter-based Python application** that lets you:
- Input paired numerical data (e.g., hours studied vs test scores)
- Instantly **visualize scatter plots**, **regression lines**, and **compute the Pearson correlation coefficient (r)**
- Understand the strength & direction of the relationship
- Save results and plots with just a click!

Perfect for:
- **Students** learning about statistics
- **Educators** explaining correlation concepts
- **Data analysts** exploring linear relationships

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Clean GUI with modern controls  
✅ Real-time plotting with `matplotlib`  
✅ Interprets strength of correlation (e.g., weak, strong, negative, none)  
✅ Shows all intermediate calculations (Σx, Σy, Σxy, etc.)  
✅ Easy saving of data and plots  
✅ Supports custom data input  
✅ Open-source and offline-ready

### 💡 How to Use

1. Launch the app
2. Enter data like:
   ```
   [(5, 64), (10, 86), (4, 69), (6, 86), (10, 59), (9, 87)]
   ```
3. Click **Plot Data**
4. View the **scatter plot**, **line of best fit**, and **correlation coefficient**
5. Use 💾 buttons to save your work
6. Exit anytime with ❌
